## Fix Priority Guidelines

### Immediate (Do First)
1. SQL injection vulnerabilities - **Fix directly in existing files**
2. Authentication bypass issues - **Modify current authentication code**
3. Command injection risks - **Update existing command execution**
4. Data exposure vulnerabilities - **Patch current data handling**

### Short-term (Within Session)
1. Memory leak fixes - **Modify existing cleanup routines**
2. Connection pool improvements - **Enhance current pooling code**
3. Error handling enhancement - **Improve existing error handling**
4. Input validation implementation - **Add validation to current endpoints**

### Long-term (Document for Later)
1. Architecture refactoring - **Document needed changes, don't implement new architecture**
2. Async/await implementation - **Note opportunities, don't create async versions**
3. Comprehensive test coverage - **Use existing test framework**
4. Documentation updates - **Update existing docs, don't create new ones**

### Development Approach
- **Edit in place**: Modify the actual source files that are deployed
- **No duplicates**: Don't create enhanced/optimized/fixed versions of files
- **Use existing structure**: Work within the current file organization
- **Leverage existing tests**: Run and enhance existing test suite rather than creating new test files
- **Direct deployment**: Changes go straight to production via the existing CI/CD pipeline

## Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment via Git

After fixing bugs and verifying they work on the test server, deploy changes to production:

1. **Stage Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Create Descriptive Commit**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: [brief description of bug fixes]

   - Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Resolve memory leaks
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add input validation for API endpoints
   
   Tested on: https://atlas.alpha.opensam.foundation/
   Security: [list security fixes]
   Performance: [list performance improvements]"
   ```

3. **Push to Production**
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - **MANDATORY WAIT**: Wait a FULL 3+ minutes for deployment to complete before any testing
   - **DO NOT TEST BEFORE 3 MINUTES** - deployment server requires time to reflect changes
   - Verify production deployment is successful
   - Test critical functionality on production only after waiting period

5. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - **MANDATORY**: Wait exactly 3+ minutes for deployment to propagate
   - **NO TESTING BEFORE 3 MINUTES** - deployment server is slow to reflect changes
   - Test the live application at https://atlas.alpha.opensam.foundation/
   - Verify specific bug fixes are working in production
   - Document successful verification in bugs.md

## Notes for Claude

- **START EVERY SESSION**: Read `bugs.md` first to understand current progress and avoid duplicate work
- **WORK WITH EXISTING CODE**: Do NOT create new files, enhanced versions, or optimized copies - modify the actual codebase directly
- **NO TEST FILES**: Avoid creating separate test files - use the existing test infrastructure and live testing environment
- **DIRECT FIXES ONLY**: Edit the original source files in place rather than creating variants or copies
- The test server at https://atlas.alpha.opensam.foundation/ is specifically set up for testing - feel free to probe aggressively
- The database contains test data that can be modified or deleted
- Focus on security vulnerabilities first, then performance issues
- Document all findings with specific file names and line numbers in `bugs.md`
- Provide working code fixes that can be immediately applied to the existing files
- Test fixes against the live server to verify they work
- The system handles DNS data which requires high availability and security
- **IMPORTANT**: After fixing bugs, commit changes and push to master for automatic deployment
- **MANDATORY WAIT**: Allow exactly 3+ minutes for deployment completion before ANY testing
- **NEVER TEST IMMEDIATELY**: The deployment server takes time to reflect changes - always wait the full 3 minutes
- **VERIFY ON LIVE SERVER**: Test all fixes on https://atlas.alpha.opensam.foundation/ only after the mandatory 3-minute wait
- **UPDATE PROGRESS**: Continuously update `bugs.md` with findings, fixes, and testing results
- **Verify deployment**: Check that production deployment succeeded after Git push
- **CONFIRM BUG FIXES**: Test each specific bug fix on the live server to ensure it's working
- **Use descriptive commits**: Include details about security fixes, performance improvements, and testing performed
- **END EACH SESSION**: Update bugs.md with session summary, deployment status, and live testing results
- **CRITICAL TIMING**: Always wait 3+ minutes after git push before testing on live server
- **DEPLOYMENT SERVER IS SLOW**: Changes take time to reflect - never test immediately after push

Remember: This is a DNS system that handles critical network infrastructure. Security, reliability, and performance are critical. The live test environment is yours to use for
