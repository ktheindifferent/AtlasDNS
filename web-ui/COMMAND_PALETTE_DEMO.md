## Architecture

### Components
- `/src/components/CommandPalette/index.tsx` - Main command palette component
- `/src/components/CommandPalette/styles.css` - Styling with dark mode support

### Hooks
- `/src/hooks/useCommandHistory.ts` - Manages command history and persistence
- `/src/hooks/useAISearch.ts` - Provides AI-powered search suggestions

### Integration
- Integrated into `/src/components/Layout.tsx`
- Available globally throughout the application
- Works with React Router for navigation

## Customization Options

### Adding New Commands
Edit `/src/components/CommandPalette/index.tsx` and add to the `commands` array:

```typescript
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  title: 'Command Name',
  subtitle: 'Description',
  icon: IconComponent,
  action: () => { /* action code */ },
  keywords: ['search', 'terms'],
  category: 'Category Name',
  shortcut: 'cmd+x',
  aliases: ['alias1', 'alias2']
}
```

### Customizing AI Suggestions
Edit `/src/hooks/useAISearch.ts` to add new patterns:

```typescript
{
  pattern: /your-pattern/i,
  suggestions: [
    'Suggestion 1',
    'Suggestion 2'
  ]
}
```

### Styling
Modify `/src/components/CommandPalette/styles.css` for custom appearance.
The component supports both light and dark modes automatically.
