## Notes

### Priority Guidelines
1. **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, service outages
2. **High**: Core functionality, performance issues, important features
3. **Medium**: Nice-to-have features, optimizations, documentation
4. **Low**: Cosmetic changes, experimental features

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: 80%+ code coverage target
- Integration tests: All major workflows
- Performance tests: Baseline metrics established
- Security tests: Regular vulnerability scanning
- Chaos tests: Failure scenario validation

### Release Criteria
- All tests passing
- No critical or high priority bugs
- Documentation complete
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security audit passed

### Next Actions
1. Start with creating unit tests for recently added modules
2. Fix any test failures discovered
3. Complete partially implemented features
4. Run integration tests
5. Update documentation based on changes
